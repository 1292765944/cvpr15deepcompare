Code for CVPR15 paper "Learning to Compare Image Patches via Convolutional Neural Networks"
-----
This package allows researches to apply the described networks to match image patches and extract corresponding patches.

We tried to make the code as easy to use as possible. The original models were trained with Torch ( http://torch.ch ) and we release the models in Torch7 format, and in addition to that we have C++ bindings which do not require Torch installation. Thus we provide example code how to use the models in MATLAB and with OpenCV http://opencv.org

Installation
-----
The code was tested to work in Linux (Ubuntu 14.04) and OS X 10.10, although we release all the source code to enable usage in other operating systems.

### Models

We provide the models in 3 formats, two are Torch7 "nn" and "cudnn" formats and one is binary format with weights only.

#### nn format

Models in nn format can be loaded and used without CUDA support in Torch. To enable CUDA support ```model:cuda()``` call required.

#### cudnn format

Model in cudnn format are faster, but need a special library from NVIDIA. Check https://github.com/soumith/cudnn.torch

#### binary format

Same table, not here yet.

### C++ code

We release CUDA code for the time being, CPU code might be added in the future. To install it you need to have CUDA 7.0 with the up-to-date CUDA driver.
Clone and compile this repository it with:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/szagoruyko/cvpr15deepmatch
cd cvpr15deepmatch
mkdir build; cd build;
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../install
make -j4 install
```
